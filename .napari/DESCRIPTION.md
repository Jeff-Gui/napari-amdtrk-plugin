# Description

This plugin provides an interface to manually amend 2D segmentation and track (time-series images) within napari. It contains a reader to parse images and object tables in a file folder. Amended data can be saved through the plugin. The plugin aims to speed up data curation for quantitative analysis and labeling for the machine learning ground truth.
